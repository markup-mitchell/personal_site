My first attempt at a personal site was somewhat rushed together in response to the FAC10 application prerequisites.

I was pleased with myself at the time, but became **very** dissatisfied **very** quickly.

Rather than try to update that effort, I am starting from scratch.

Initial focus is on proper structuring, accessibility, cross-browser compatibility and well-formed code.

Unsure whether to use frameworks at this stage. Might leave that out until I have experimented more.
